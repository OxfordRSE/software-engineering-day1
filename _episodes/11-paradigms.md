### Imperative Programming
Code describes how data should be processed.

#### Structured Programming
Code should be grouped into logical blocks.

Early examples: Algol (1958)

#### Procedural Programming
Code should be grouped into procedures performing a single task.

Early examples: FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1959)

#### Object Oriented Programming
Data should be structured.  Code should be stored with the data it processes.

Early examples: Smalltalk (1972)

### Declarative Programming
Code describes what the result of data processing should be

#### Functional Programming
Functions are mathematical operations and should perform exactly one task.  Code is data.

Early examples: Lisp (1958)
