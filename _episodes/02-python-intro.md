## Introduction to Python

See topic [slides](../slides/02-python-intro.html).

## Running the Python Interpreter

Normally, you write Python programs in a Python script, which is basically a file of Python commands you can run,
or within a Jupyter notebook, which is an interactive script of Python commands that gives you results of your commands as you enter them.
We'll come on to Notebooks and scripts later. But to start with, we'll take a look at the Python interpreter.
It's similar to the shell in how it works, in that you type in commands and it
gives you results back, but instead you use the Python language.

It's a really quick and convenient way to get started with Python, particularly when learning about things like how to use variables, and it's good for playing around with what you can do and quickly testing small things.
But as you progress to more interesting and complex things you need to move over to writing proper Python scripts, which we'll see later.

You start the Python interpreter from the shell by:

~~~
$ python
~~~
{:.language-bash}

And then you are presented with something like:

~~~
Python 3.4.3 |Anaconda 2.3.0 (x86_64)| (default, Mar  6 2015, 12:07:41) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
~~~
{: .output}

And lo and behold! You are presented with yet another prompt.
So, we're actually running a Python interpreter from the shell - it's only yet another program we can run from the shell after all.
But shell commands won't work again until we exit the interpreter.

You can exit the interpreter and get back to the shell by typing:

~~~
>>> exit()
~~~
{: .language-python}

...or alternatively pressing the Control and D keys at the same time.
Then you'll see:

~~~
$
~~~
{: .output}

So now you're back in the shell.


## Variables

Compared to some other languages such as C++ or JavaScript, variables in Python do not need to be declared before assigning something to them, for example:

~~~
six = 2*3
print(six)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
6
~~~
{: .output}

If we look for a variable that hasn't ever been defined, we get an error telling us so:

~~~
print(seven)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'seven' is not defined
~~~
{: .output}

You can also assign an arbitrary number of variables on the same line:

~~~
one, two = 1, 2
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Sorting out references

> What does the following program print out?
>
> ~~~
> first, second = 1, 2
> third, fourth = second, first
> print(third, fourth)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > 2 1
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Although we commonly refer to `variables` even in Python (because it is the common terminology), we really mean `names` or `identifiers`. In Python, `variables` are name tags for values, not labelled boxes that contain a value.

So we can now develop a better understanding of our labels and boxes: each box is a piece of space (an address) in computer memory. Each label (variable) is a reference to such a place.

When the number of labels on a box ("variables referencing an address") gets down to zero, then the data in the box cannot be found any more.

After a while, the language's "Garbage collector" will wander by, notice a box with no labels, and throw the data away, making that box available for more data.

Older languages like C and Fortran don't have Garbage collectors. So a memory address with no references to it still takes up memory, and the computer can more easily run out.

So when I write:

~~~
number = 1
number = 2
~~~
{: .language-python}

The following things happen:

1. A new integer object '2' is created, and an address in memory is found for it.
1. The variable "number" is moved to refer to that address.
1. The old address, containing '1', now has no labels.
1. The garbage collector frees the memory at the old address.


## Objects and Types

An object, like name, has a type. We can use `type()` to tell us the type of the variable. For our variable above:

~~~
type(number)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Note we don't need to use `print` - the Python interpreter will just output the result:

~~~
<class 'int'>
~~~
{: .output}

Depending on its type, an object can have different properties: data fields *inside* the object.

Consider a Python complex number for example:

~~~
z = 3+1j
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can see what properties and methods an object has available using the dir function:

~~~
dir(z)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
['__abs__',
 '__add__',
 '__bool__',
 '__class__',
 '__delattr__',
 '__dir__',
 '__divmod__',
 '__doc__',
 '__eq__',
 '__float__',
 '__floordiv__',
 '__format__',
 '__ge__',
 '__getattribute__',
 '__getnewargs__',
 '__gt__',
 '__hash__',
 '__init__',
 '__int__',
 '__le__',
 '__lt__',
 '__mod__',
 '__mul__',
 '__ne__',
 '__neg__',
 '__new__',
 '__pos__',
 '__pow__',
 '__radd__',
 '__rdivmod__',
 '__reduce__',
 '__reduce_ex__',
 '__repr__',
 '__rfloordiv__',
 '__rmod__',
 '__rmul__',
 '__rpow__',
 '__rsub__',
 '__rtruediv__',
 '__setattr__',
 '__sizeof__',
 '__str__',
 '__sub__',
 '__subclasshook__',
 '__truediv__',
 'conjugate',
 'imag',
 'real']
~~~
{: .output}

You can see that there are several methods whose name starts and ends with `__` (e.g. `__init__`): these are special methods that Python uses internally, and we will discuss some of them later on in this course. The others (in this case, conjugate, `img` and `real`) are the methods and fields through which we can interact with this object.

~~~
type(z)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'complex'>
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
z.real
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
3.0
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
z.imag
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
1.0
~~~
{: .output}

A property of an object is accessed with a dot. The jargon is that the "dot operator" is used to obtain a property of an object.


## Other Basic Python Data Types

Since we're not declaring the type of a variable, how does it work it out?

Python is an interpreted language that is *dynamically typed*, which means the type of a variable is determined and *bound* to the variable at runtime from its given value. So when we assign a floating point number, for example, it's type is inferred:

### Floats

~~~
weight_kg = 55
weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
print('Weight in kg', weight_lb)
~~~
{: .language-python}

For a float, a number after a point is optional. But the *dot* makes it a float.

~~~
Weight in kg 121.00000000000001
~~~
{: .output}

So the thing with floats is that they are *representation* of a real number. Representing a third or the root of 2 would be impossible for a computer, so these are really approximations of real numbers using an ubiquitous standard (IEEE-754).

As the example above shows, we can print several things at once by separating them with commas.

An important thing to remember, particularly in numerical analyses, is that a `float` in Python is double precision.

> in the following program:
>
> ~~~
> weight = 70.5
> age = 35
> weight = weight * 1.14
> age = age + 20
> ~~~
{: .challenge}

### Strings

Note that before, we also used a `string` in our use of `print`. In Python, we can use either single quotes or double quotes, or even both if we need to include quotes within a string, e.g.:

~~~
given = 'Joe'
middle = "Frederick"
family = "'Bloggs'"
full = given + " " + middle + " " + family
print(full)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we use the `+` operator to concatenate strings together.

~~~
"Joe Frederick 'Bloggs'"
~~~
{: .output}

We've looked at properties on objects. But many objects can also have *methods* (types of functions), which we can use to perform operations on the object.

For strings, we can do things like:

~~~
given.upper()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Which returns the upper case version of the string.

~~~
'JOE'
~~~
{: .output}

Note it isn't changing the object

~~~
'    Hello'.strip()
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
'Hello'
~~~
{: .output}

### Booleans

We can use boolean variables to capture `True` or `False`, useful in conditionals and loops, e.g.:

~~~
is_joe = (given == 'Joe')
flag = False
print(is_joe, flag)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
True False
~~~
{: .output}

### No Value?

We can also assign variable with no value:

~~~
nothing = None
print(nothing)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
None
~~~
{: .output}

`None` is the special Python value for a no-value variable.

If that's the output, what's the type of `nothing`?

~~~
type(nothing)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'NoneType'>
~~~
{: .output}

Python also supports complex (imaginary) numbers, if you're interested.

### Converting Between Types

With floats, ints and strings, we can use in-built functions to convert between types:

~~~
age, house_number = 30, '76'
print(str(age), float(age), int(house_number), float(house_number))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
30 30.0 76 76.0
~~~
{: .output}


## Containers

*Container* types are those that can hold other objects.

### Lists

One of the most fundamental data structures in any language is the array, used to hold many values at once. Python doesnâ€™t have a native array data structure, but it has the list which is much more general and can be used as a multidimensional array quite easily. You'll likely find, for general purposes, you'll be using lists a lot. How you use them also forms the basis for how you use more specialised types of containers we'll see later.

To define a list we simply write a comma separated list of items in square brackets:

~~~
odds = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]
more_numbers = [ [1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [ [6, 7], [8] ] ]
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can see that our multi-dimensional array can contain elements themselves of any size and depth. This could be used as way of representing matrices, but later we'll learn a better way to represent these.

A list in Python is just an ordered collection of items which can be of any type. By comparison an array is an ordered collection of items of a single type - so a list is more flexible than an array.

~~~
various_things = [1, 2, 'banana', 3.4, [1, 2] ]
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can select individual elements from lists by indexing them:

~~~
print(odds[0], odds[-1])
~~~
{: .language-python}

This will print the first and last elements of a list:

~~~
1 15
~~~
{: .output}

FIXME: add indexing a list image

We can replace elements within a specific part of the list (note that in Python, indexes start at 0):

~~~
odds[6] = 13
~~~
{: .language-python}

We can also *slice* lists to either extract or set an arbitrary subset of the list:

~~~
odds[2:5]
~~~
{: .language-python}

FIXME: add slicing a list image

~~~
[5, 7, 9]
~~~
{: .output}

We can also leave out either start or end parts and they will assume their maximum possible value:

~~~
odds[5:]
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[11, 13]
~~~
{: .output}

Or even:

~~~
odds[:]
~~~
{: .language-python}

Which will show us the whole list.

~~~
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
~~~
{: .output}

> ## Indexing and Slicing Strings?
>
> Conceptually, a string is a type of container, in this case of letters. We can also index and slice strings in the same way as a list:
>
> ~~~
> element = 'oxygen'
> print(element[1], element[0:3], element[3:6])
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
> ~~~
> oxy gen
> ~~~
> {: .output}
> Which demonstrates a key design principle behind Python: "there should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it."
> "To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in Python culture." - Alex Martelli, Python Software Foundation Fellow.
{: .callout}

We can also add and delete elements from a Python list at any time:

~~~
odds.append(21)
del odds[0]
odds
~~~
{: .language-python}

Which will show us the list with a '21' added to the end and its first element removed:

~~~
[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 21]
~~~
{: .output}

We can also check if an element is within a list:

~~~
9 in odds
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
True
~~~
{: .output}

### Tuples

A tuple is an immutable sequence. It is like a list, execpt it cannot be changed. It is defined with round brackets.

~~~
x = 0,
type(x)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'tuple'>
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
my_tuple = ("Hello", "World")
my_tuple[0] = "Goodbye"
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
~~~
{: .output}

### Sets

A Python set is equivalent to a set in mathematics. It may contain many values of different types, as long as they are immutable (e.g. integers, strings, floats, tuples), but is strictly unordered. Indeed, set elements are usually not stored in the order they appear within a set, which enables Python to do faster checking whether an element is in a set.

~~~
x = {1, 2}
y = {1, 2, 1}
print(x == y)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Since x and y are equal sets, we get:

~~~
True
~~~
{: .output}

As you may expect, you can also perform standard set operations on sets. For union:

~~~
a = {4, 5, 6}
b = {6, 7, 8}
a.union(b)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
~~~
{: .output}

We can also do intersection:

~~~
a.intersection(b)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{6}
~~~
{: .output}

And difference:

~~~
a.difference(b)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
{4, 5}
~~~
{: .output}

You can also do other useful operations on sets, such as removing elements of one set from another, if one is a subset or superset of another, and so on.

> ## Mutability
>
> An important thing to remember is that Python variables are simply *references* to values, and also that they fall into two distinct types:
>
> * Immutable types: value changes by referencing a newly created value, e.g. when changing a letter in a string
> * Mutable types: values can be changed 'in place', e.g. changing or adding an item in a list
>
> This matters when you are 'copying' variables or passing them as arguments to functions.
