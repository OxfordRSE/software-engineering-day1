## Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks

See topic [slides](../slides/03-ide-notebook.html).

## An Example Notebook

## Launching the Jupyter Notebook Application

Fortunately, Jupyter notebooks are supported by default by the Anaconda distribution. On the command line, we can tell Jupyter to launch its notebook interface:

~~~
jupyter notebook
~~~
{: .language-bash}

A local web application is hosted and a browser is launched to give you access to the application. From this interface, we can create and manage our notebooks.

## Our first Notebook

Let's give you a taste of what's possible in a Jupyter notebook, and introduce you to some new Python concepts along the way.

We're going to make use of a couple of Python modules that allow us to analyse and manipulate numerical data, and visualise that data. We'll be covering these in more detail tomorrow, but:

- **NumPy:** very popular package for scientific computing. Supports N-dimensional array objects, sophisticated matrix manipulation functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, support for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and much more.
- **matplotlib:** 2D plotting library for producing publication quality figures in many formats.

### Anatomy of a Notebook

Jupyter notebooks consist of discussion cells, referred to as *markdown cells*, and *code cells*, which contain Python. In markdown cells, we can insert plain text, such as discussions, explanations, etc., which is great for setting the context of what we are doing for the reader. These can be thought of as comments in code, but they're much more than that - we can apply formatting to these to change appearance, particularly useful for section headings, which allows us to properly structure a notebook with a narrative.

We'll concentrate on using code cells for now.

### Importing the Libraries

To allow us to use the two libraries, we need to first *import* them into our notebook. On the first line of our notebook, enter the following (don't type in the line beginning `In...`, since this just shows us the intended line number in the notebook):

~~~
In [1]:
%matplotlib inline
import numpy
from matplotlib import pyplot
~~~
{: .language-python}

The first line is known as a notebook *magic*, and tells matplotlib that we want its output to be displayed inline, in our case within a notebook, instead of in a separate window. This means our visualisations, as we generate them, will be displayed immediately.

The next two lines tell Python that we want to load each library. The first one tells Python that we want to import (and make use of) the NumPy library, and we'll refer to this library in our code by using `numpy`. The second one indicates we want to import a specific module within the matplotlib library called `pyplot`, and we will refer to this module as `pyplot`.

When you've entered that, press `Shift`+`Enter`. This will *run* this cell in the notebook within Python. If there's any output, this will be displayed, although in this case there won't be. You'll alo notice that the notebook has helpfully given us another cell to enter more things into the notebook.

### Load our Example Dataset

We going to use an example dataset based on a clinical trial of inflammation in patients who have been given a new treatment for arthritis. The data sets are stored in comma-separated values (CSV) format: each row holds information for a single patient, and the columns represent successive days.

We can now use NumPy to load our dataset into a Python variable. In the next cell, enter:

~~~
In [2]:
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Again, press `Shift`+`Enter` to run the cell.

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a function call that asks Python to run the function `loadtxt` that belongs to the `numpy` library. We give `loadtxt()` two arguments: one telling it the CSV file to load, and another telling it that the data on each row is separated by a comma.

Once loaded into `data`, we can then take a look at the contents of that variable:

~~~
In [3]:
print(data)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This time, there is output, which we see displayed directly afterwards in the notebook:

~~~
Out [3]:
array([[0., 0., 1., ..., 3., 0., 0.],
       [0., 1., 2., ..., 1., 0., 1.],
       [0., 1., 1., ..., 2., 1., 1.],
       ...,
       [0., 1., 1., ..., 1., 1., 1.],
       [0., 0., 0., ..., 0., 2., 0.],
       [0., 0., 1., ..., 1., 1., 0.]])
~~~
{: .output}

By default, only a few rows and columns are shown (with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays). To save space, Python displays numbers as `1.` instead of `1.0` when thereâ€™s nothing interesting after the decimal point.

The data in this case has 60 rows (one for each patient) and 40 columns (one for each day). Each cell in the data represents an inflammation reading for that day. So this shows the results of measuring the inflammation of 60 patients over a 40 day period.

{: .callout}

### Visualising our Example Dataset

Now we have our inflammation dataset loaded, let's visualise some of it. Let's look at the first patient's data. In the next cell:

~~~
In [4]:
inf_plot = pyplot.plot(data[0])
~~~
{: .language-python}

Note that as with lists, NumPy arrays also start at zero. So here, we are looking at just the first row of data, i.e. the first patient.

FIXME: insert graph image of first patient's data

Here we can see a graph of the first patient's inflammation over the 40 day period, clearly indicating a trend towards a peak in the middle of the trial, and a trend towards zero inflammation after that.

What's interesting is that we've used a notebook to very quickly visualise part of our data.

### A Warning about Object State

When I type code in the notebook, the objects live in memory between cells. So far, we've entered Python into each cell in order, and each cell has been evaluated in order. But we can also change cell contents and re-evaluate them.

If we go back and edit cell `[2]` to the following to change the data points on day 11 for our first patient:

~~~
In [2]:
data[0][10] = 8.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

But we haven't re-evaluated that cell yet, so it's important to note that the notebook is now in an *inconsistent* state: the following cells have not taken this change into account. So we have to be careful!

Let's go ahead and press `Shift`+`Enter` to re-evaluate that cell and change our dataset.

Since the Python we entered doesn't output anything, we see the output from that cell disappears. We can also see that the number for that cell changes to `[4]`. This indicates that it's the 4th cell evaluated in our notebook (replacing the previous 2nd cell).

But the following graph is still showing an old value for the 10th day. We could re-evaluate this cell too, but if we had many other cells, it would be tiresome to re-evaluate them all.

The thing to remember is that cells are not always evaluated in order - it depends on how we change and evaluate our notebook.

To ensure we have a our notebook in a consistent state, we can re-evaluate all cells in the entire notebook by selecting the `>>` icon. We can now see that our graph displays the correct value for day 10.

> ## A More Explicit Example of Object State
>
> If I set a variable in a notebook:
>
> ~~~
> number = 0
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> And then in the next cell enter:
>
> ~~~
> number = number + 1
> print(number)
> ~~~
> {: .language-python}
>
> We'll get:
>
> ~~~
> 1
> ~~~
> {: .output}
>
> However, if we constantly re-evaluate the second cell, the number will continue to increment. So it's important to remember that if you move your cursor around in the notebook and change things, it doesn't always run top to bottom.
{: .callout}

## Saving and Reloading a Notebook

We can also save the state of a notebook and reload it later. First, let's give our notebook a name. select the `.ipynb` title at the top of the notebook and enter a filename ending in `.ipynb`, e.g. `Inflammation.ipynb`.

If you select `File` > `Save as...`, leave the directory option blank, then select `Save`, the notebook will be saved in the directory where you started the Jupyter notebook.

## Exporting a Notebook to Another Format

You also have the option to export your notebook and save it in a different format. There are many formats, but include Python scripts and PDF.

To export a PDF version of your notebook, go to `File` > `Download as` > `pdf (.pdf)`. This will download the notebook with a title, date, and its content (both markdown and code cells' contents).
