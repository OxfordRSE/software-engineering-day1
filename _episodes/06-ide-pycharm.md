title: "PyCharm as an Integrated Development Environment"
teaching: 40
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is PyCharm and what are the advantages of using it?"
- "How can my scripts do different things based on data values?"
- "How can I do the same operations on many different values?"
objectives:
- "Set up a development environment in PyCharm."
- "Use if statements to conditionally process Python statements."
- "Use loops to iteratively process collections of values."
- "Use PyCharm to write a Python script that uses conditionals and loops."
- "Store and retrieve Python scripts in PyCharm."
keypoints:
- "PyCharm needs to be configured to know which Python interpreter to use for a given project."
- "Use for variable in sequence to process the elements of a sequence one at a time."
- "The body of a for loop must be indented."
- "Use len(thing) to determine the length of something that contains other values."
- "Use `if` condition to start a conditional statement, `elif` condition to provide additional tests, and `else` to provide a default.
- "The bodies of the branches of conditional statements must be indented."
- "Use `==` to test for equality, `!=` for inequality."
- "`X and Y` is only true if both `X` and `Y` are true."
- "`X or Y` is true if either `X` or `Y`, or both, are true."
- "Zero, the empty string, and the empty list are considered false; all other numbers, strings, and lists are considered true."
- "`True` and `False` represent truth values."
