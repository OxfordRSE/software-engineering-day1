title: Instructor Notes: Common Q&A session questions
---

Here are some general suggestions for questions that can be asked at the start of any Q&A session, which concerns material from the session before:

- Request learners feedback for session for each of these questions, using Zoom's Yes (green tick) No (red cross) reactions, which should be recorded:
    - Did you largely know this material before?
    - Did you encounter anything interesting?
    - Do you think what you learnt in this session will be useful in your research work?
    - Were you able to find a demonstrator when you needed one?
- Check progress with material - Yes/No to whether learners completed each of the previous sessions' episodes, to get an idea of general progress and any potential learning obstacles
- What problems did people have?
- Any questions about the material?
- Quick summary of what's coming next
