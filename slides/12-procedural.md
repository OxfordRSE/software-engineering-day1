## Programming Paradigms

* What is a paradigm?
* What paradigms exist?
* How do I know which one to use?

## Paradigms

> In science and philosophy, a **paradigm** (/ˈpærədaɪm/) is a distinct set of **concepts or thought patterns**, including theories, research methods, postulates, and standards for what constitutes legitimate contributions to a field.

## A Brief History

## Imperative Programming
> Code describes **how** data is processed

- A family of paradigms

## Structured Programming
> Code should be grouped into logical blocks

- Imperative family
- Early example: Algol (1958)

## Procedural Programming
> Code should be grouped into procedures performing a single task

- Derived from Structured Programming
- Early examples: FORTRAN II (1958), COBOL (1959)

## Object Oriented Programming
> Data should be structured. Code belongs with data

- Derived from Procedural Programming
- Early examples: Simula (1967), Smalltalk (1972)

## Declarative Programming
> Code describes **what** processing should occur

- A family of paradigms

## Functional Programming
> Functions are mathematical operations. Code is data

- Declarative family
- Early examples: Lisp (1958)
