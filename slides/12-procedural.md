## A Brief History

## Imperative Family
> Code describes **how** data processing should happen

## Structured Programming
> Code should be grouped into logical blocks

- Imperative family
- Early example: Algol (1958)

## Procedural Programming
> Code should be grouped into procedures performing a single task

- Derived from Structured Programming
- Early examples: FORTRAN II (1958), COBOL (1959)

## Object Oriented Programming
> Data should be structured. Code belongs with data

- Derived from Procedural Programming
- Early examples: Simula (1967), Smalltalk (1972)

## Declarative Family
> Code describes **what** data processing should happen

## Functional Programming
> Functions are mathematical operations. Code is data

- Declarative family
- Early examples: Lisp (1958)
