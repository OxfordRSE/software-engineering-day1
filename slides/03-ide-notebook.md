## What is a Jupyter Notebook?

- An *Integrated Development Environment*, or IDE
- Like the interpreter, but previous commands are interactive
    + Can edit previous commands
    + Output is recalculated
- Can mix code with discussion, commentary, and results (e.g. text output, graphs)

## An Example Notebook

FIXME: add image of notebook with annotations

## Why Use Notebooks?

- Support for many languages, e.g. Python, Java, R, Julia, Fortran, ...
- Many helpful features
- Can save notebooks as a reproducible process to generate output
  ++ An 'interactive paper'
- Can export notebooks in various other formats, e.g. PDF
- Excellent for research, demonstration, and teaching, especially for science

## How Does it Work?

- Interactive notebooks are hosted by a server and provided via a web browser
- Temporary notebooks hosted via jupyter.org
- Install and use Jupyter locally
