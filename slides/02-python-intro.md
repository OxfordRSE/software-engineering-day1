% Introduction to Python
% SSI

## Administration

* Combination of lectures, 'live coding' practical sessions

## Why Python?

- Free, well-documented, runs almost everywhere
- Large (and growing) user base among researchers and scientists
- Simple, readable, flexible, powerful language and easier for beginners to grasp
- Great for team working
    + Python aim - only one way to do something
    + Programs look very similar, easy for others to read
- Want to teach basic programming concepts that can be applied to other programming languages

## What can you use it for?

- Almost anything - it's general purpose!
- Used in many fields
     + Bioinformatics, Biology, Data visualisation, Engineering, Software development, etc.
- Used for processing data, general scripting, mapping, web applications, frameworks,
numerical processing, education, HPC, at Google, ...

## Python is up and coming!

- FIXME
- Based on Southampton PhD students software usage survey conducted by SSI's Policy researchers:

## We'll be teaching Python 3

- Python 3 is currently the standard version
- We'll teach using version 3!
- Python 3 has many advantages over Python 2
    + Many consistency improvements - removing redundancy
    + In places, simply more sensible e.g. integer division
    + Python 2 support will end in 2020
    + 'Short version: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language'
- For new projects, use Python 3!

## Many different kinds of Python

- Python interpreter - via the command line
- Jupyter Notebook - mix code, commentary, and results
- Python scripts - a 'program' in a file to run
- PyCharm - edit, run, and debug Python scripts

## Learning objectives

- how to assign values to variables, Python types, simple operations
- how to repeat actions with loops
- how to make choices using conditionals
- how to write procedural Python code
- how to write object oriented Python code
